          I have over 14 years of experience as a software engineer, and have
          worked at various clients. While I'm a proficient full-stack
          developer, my expertise and interest is in building scalable web
          applicatins using javascript frameworks (React, Angular).
        </p>
        <p>
          I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often
          intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real
          customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a
          senior individual contributor role where I can be involved in
          implementation part of the application, and gain experience with
          architecture.
